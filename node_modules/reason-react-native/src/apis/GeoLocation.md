`GeoLocation` has been removed from React Native.

Please refer to [bindings](https://github.com/reason-react-native/geolocation)
for the replacement
[community package](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation).

In order to take advantage of newer API on Android, please consider either
[react-native-geolocation-service](https://github.com/Agontuk/react-native-geolocation-service)
or [react-native-location](https://github.com/timfpark/react-native-location) as
replacements.
