## 0.62.0 - 2020-07-20

The release we all have been waiting for (thanks for you patience)!  
Huge thanks to [@sgny](https://github.com/sgny) which handled most of the
changes directly related to react-native 0.62.

**tl;dr**: this release includes

- breaking changes related to `reason-react@0.8`
- breaking changes related to `bs-platform@7` (say bye to most `##` accessors in
  favor of `.`)
- breaking changes related to `react-native@0.62` (say bye to removed
  components)

So in order to upgrade to this release you need to upgrade all this dependencies
at the same time. Be sure to respect
[`peerDependencies`](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/blob/0.62.0/package.json#L4)
before reporting issue.

### ðŸš€ Upgrades & ðŸ’¥ Breaking changes
